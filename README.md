About publishing you can learn short tutorial [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-and-publish-your-first-npm-package/)

In our case publishing is done by these steps

1. commit ready code -> push ready code, **dont forget increase version by one point in package.json** for example if current version is 1.0.0, you need before commit increase version to 1.0.1
2. generate dist folder by building project, by running command **npm run prod**
3. sign in from terminal in [npm](npmjs.org) portal by running command **npm login**
4. publish builded project to npm by running command **npm publish**
5. you can see library [here](https://github.com/evident-development/evident-ui-components)
